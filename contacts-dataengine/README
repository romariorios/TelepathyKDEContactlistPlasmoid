The Telepathy contact (person) list data engine.

FIXME (ordered by priority):
 - A lot of display names are not being displayed on the applet, but
only in plasmaengineexplorer.

TODO (ordered by priority):
 - Defining whether setting a source for each contact and another for
the amount of contacts is the best way to retrieve the people.

DONE:
 - Use PersonSet instead of ContactListModel.
 - Set other data to each person (avatar, display name, etc.).
